Agent-based spatial and stochastic model of tumor growth written in Python 3.x. <img src="data/tumor.gif">

There are two types of cells - those that replicate ('cycle' in biological terms) and those that don't (called 'quiescent' by biologists). 

[A Jupyter Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/petermchale/tumor/blob/master/demonstration.ipynb?flush_cache=true) illustrates how to simulate the model, analyze data generated by the model, and visualize the results of the analysis to maximize insight.

To play with this code, and/or contribute to it, download this repository, open `Terminal` (on a Mac), navigate to the repository, and execute the following commands at the command line:
```
cd data
python ../tumor_package/animate.py
