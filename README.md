tumor
======
Agent-based spatial and stochastic model of tumor growth written in Python 3.x. <img src="data/tumor.gif">

Description
======
Code simulates cell proliferation, e.g. as would occur in a nascent tumor. There are two types of cells - those that replicate ('cycle' in biological terms) and those that don't (called 'quiescent' by biologists). 

Getting started
======
To animate tumor growth, open `Terminal` (on a Mac), navigate to the repository, and execute the following commands at the command line:
```
cd data
python ../tumor/simulation.py
````

Code development
======
One goal is to make this code faster.
